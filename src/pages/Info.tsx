                  The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act
                  (MGNREGA) is an Indian labor law and social security measure
                  that aims to guarantee the 'right to work'. It provides at
                  least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every
                  household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual
                  work.

              <FAQItem
                question="What is a Person-Day?"
                answer="A person-day is a unit of measurement. It means one person working for one full day. For example, if 50 people work for 10 days, that creates 500 person-days of employment."

              <FAQItem
                question="How are wages calculated?"
                answer="Workers are paid based on the number of days they work. The wage rate is set by the government and varies by state. Payment is made directly to the worker's bank account within 15 days of work completion."
